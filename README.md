## About

### Profession

Currently, I am a freelance full-stack developer and looking for a full-time front-end developer job. By job I mean, not just a job, but also an environment in which I could continually improve my professional and human skills. As a programmer, I value clean and quality code the most. Because of that, I am always trying to provide a clean and reasonable code event if it will cost extra time for me.

#### Stack:

-   Javascript / Typescript / ReactJS / Angular / NodeJS
-   CSS / SCSS
-   HTML
-   C# / .NET / ASP.NET / WPF
-   C++ / Arduino
-   MySQL / SQLite / MongoDB

### Hobbies & Interests

#### Motorcycles

I love motorcycles and the culture of riders. It is and integral part of my life and It is starting to be more than just a hobby. It is now more like a lifestyle. The wind, engine roaring, acceleration, freedom, and a tiny bit of adrenaline are just enough to make me smile even after the worst day.

#### Music

Like many other people, I can't imagine life without music. I believe that music can tell some things about a person.
I usually vibe on rock, R&B, soul, funk, disco, and jazz (usually instrumental music) but it can variate depending on the mood.
Mostly listening to older music. The '80s is my favorite decade but it can variate around two decades up and down also.

I am always open to share my playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/11148697856?si=4c4181ea13464df6)

## Education

### Kaunas University of Technology

_(2016-09-01 - Now)_

I've started my software engineering studies with no knowledge about programming. I just knew that I like computers and tech. There was a variety of subjects that I learned over those years in university. Starting basic object-oriented programming and ending teamwork concepts. Studies developed not only software engineering skills but also soft skills like time management and responsibility. I do not have a degree yet, but I will have one in 2022.

## Experience

### Teltonika Networks - C++ / Server developer

_(2021-08-16 - now)_

### Visma Lietuva - Front-end Internship

_(2020-02-02 - 2020-03-27)_

I have made big progress during these two months. Starting with the strong fundamentals of front-end development, ending team project using Angular framework. I had two coolest mentors which shared their experience as much as they could. They trained me to respect, appreciate and produce clean and quality code.

### Freelancing Gigs

_(since 2019)_

I've done some freelancing gigs. Most of them are small. Usually, I fix problems with websites (mostly WordPress) or create custom themes and elements. Because of the big competition between WordPress developers and lack of having regular customers sometimes it is hard to get a gig.
Otherwise, sometimes I get more interesting projects. A few of them are:

- #### Jetski Race Lap Timer App

    _(2021)_

    One of the recent projects. A windows application to make jetski race referee work easier. Requested by [Lithuanian Federation of Jetski sports](https://lvmsf.lt/). It was built using __C#__ programming language, __WPF (_Windows Presentation Foundation_)__ framework and __SQLite__ database. 

    Features: 
    - Participant registration and management.
    - Importing Participants from past events.
    - Qualification calculation.
    - Lap taking.
    - Penalty setting.
    - Reports printing.
    - Combining different race classes into one.
    - Live results presentation.
   

- #### Orienteering Game Web App
    _(2019)_

    It is one of the earliest projects as a freelance developer. The project was requested by the [Ringaudai Community Center](https://ringaudai.eu/). Idea was to create a "[Å turmas](https://www.sturmas.lt/)" style app that shows participants a list of tasks (riddles). Participants should solve a riddle get to the right place. Then take a photo of himself (or themselves if it is a team) and upload it to the system. After the time is up it shows all answers, scores, mistakes, leaderboards. The administrator's part is to rate and ban participants and supervise the game. 

    
    Project is created using __React__ and __Django__ frameworks connected using __REST API__.
